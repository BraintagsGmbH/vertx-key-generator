== Generator for unique identifyers

Keygenerator is a Verticle to create unique IDs in different ways and is used by the project Vertx-Pojo-Mapper, for
instance, to locally create primary keys for new records.

### Using Keygenerator in Maven or Gradle project

Add a dependency to the artifact

.

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>de.braintags</groupId>
<artifactId>vertx-key-generator</artifactId>
<version>1.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'de.braintags:vertx-key-generator:1.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
----


=== Initialization of the verticle
The verticle is initialized by reading a local Json file. The location of this file can be defined by adding the
location into the deployment options like shown in the example above. If this property is not set, then a default
location is used, which refers to the local user directory and there inside the path
".braintags/vertx/KeyGenerator/KeyGeneratorVerticle.settings.json"
If the settings file does not exist, it will be created with some default data and then the application will exit
with an exception, which shows the location of the created settings. You will have to edit the settings file and will
have at a minimum to set the property "edited" to true, otherwise the application won't launch.

[source,java]
----
DeploymentOptions options = new DeploymentOptions();
String settingsLocation = "settings/kgSettings.json";
options.setConfig(new JsonObject().put(KeyGeneratorSettings.SETTINGS_LOCATION_PROPERTY, settingsLocation));
vertx.deployVerticle(KeyGeneratorVerticle.class.getName(), options, result -> {
  if (result.failed()) {
    startFuture.fail(result.cause());
  } else {
    startFuture.complete();
  }
});
----

Above is displayed an example settings file, which uses MongoDb as a source of key generation.

[source,java]
----
{
"edited" : true,
"keyGeneratorClass" : "de.braintags.io.vertx.keygenerator.impl.MongoKeyGenerator",
"generatorProperties" : {
"db_name" : "KeygeneratoDb",
"startMongoLocal" : "false",
"localPort" : "27018",
"connection_string" : "mongodb://192.168.42.129:27017",
"shared" : "false"
}
}
----
The main information of the settings file is the property "keyGeneratorClass", which must refer to an existing
implementation of `link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/IKeyGenerator.html[IKeyGenerator]`. Some implementations are described below.
Aside this, the field generatorProperties exists, where inside some properties must or can be defined, which are
depending on the defined keyGeneratorClass.

=== Requesting a key from an application

[source,java]
----
vertx.eventBus().send(KeyGeneratorVerticle.SERVICE_NAME, keyContext, result -> {
  if (result.failed()) {
    result.cause().printStackTrace();
  } else {
    Long id = (Long) result.result().body();
    System.out.println(id);
  }
});
----

To retrive a key, one is sending an event to the vertx eventbus, where a name can be sent as a parameter. For each
different name, which is sent here, one unique id sequence is generated. The returned id is then of type long.


=== The different versions of `link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/IKeyGenerator.html[IKeyGenerator]`

`link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/impl/DebugGenerator.html[DebugGenerator]`
Can be used for debugging or testing purpose. For each application start it starts with 0.

`link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/impl/FileKeyGenerator.html[FileKeyGenerator]`
This implementation stores the current state of the id generator as local file. By using the property
`link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/impl/FileKeyGenerator.html#DESTINATION_DIRECTORY_PROP[FileKeyGenerator.DESTINATION_DIRECTORY_PROP]` you can define the
location of this file.

`link:../../apidocs/de/braintags/io/vertx/keygenerator/impl/MongoKeyGenerator.html[MongoKeyGenerator]`
MongoKeyGenerator is using MongoDb as a source to store the state of the id generator. In the properties one will
define the location and the name of the database which shall be used.
